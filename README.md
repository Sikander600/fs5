To optimize frontend performance by implementing lazy loading of components in a React Single Page Application using React.lazy() and Suspense.

📖 Description

In this experiment, lazy loading is applied at the component level. Instead of loading all components during the initial application render, selected components are loaded dynamically only when they are needed.

React’s built-in lazy loading mechanism allows dynamic importing of components, while Suspense provides a fallback UI during loading.

🔍 What Was Implemented

Created multiple React components.

Applied dynamic component loading.

Used fallback UI during component loading.

Observed improved initial load performance.

✅ Outcome

Reduced initial bundle size.

Faster application startup.

Improved user experience with loading indicators.
